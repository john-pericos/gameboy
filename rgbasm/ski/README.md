The game was intend to be made within 4k, that is 4096 bytes in total, 
including code routines, graphics and music. The level was `predesigned' 
in a map form (In other words, not randomly made by some algorithm!).
Levels can be redesign with the use and re-compilation of the source 
files.

It has been tested on VGB-DOS and on the real GameBoy machine, and as far
as I know it works well. Thanks to MegaMan X for last minute check ups
and spotted the problem with the 'GAMEOVER' message.


Game functions:

D-Pad		- Control ski guy movement
Start		- Start game/pause game (or if in doubt, hit start!)
A       - Speed up
B       - Nothing
Select	- Nothing


I would like to credit Mike Mika for his shoddy music routine, which 
inspired me to write my own, compact music player for this game.
